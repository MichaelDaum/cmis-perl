WebService-Cmis

This library provides a CMIS client library for Perl that can be used to work with
CMIS-compliant repositories such as Alfresco, IBM FileNet, Nuxeo and others.
CMIS is an OASIS approved specification with backing by major ECM players including
those mentioned as well as Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP. 

CMIS providers must expose both Web Services and Restful AtomPub bindings.
WebService::Cmis uses the Restful AtomPub binding to communicate with the CMIS
repository. All you have to tell WebService::Cmis is the repository's service
URL and your credentials. There is nothing to install on the server side. 

See the http://docs.oasis-open.org/cmis/CMIS/v1.0/cs01/cmis-spec-v1.0.html
for a full understanding of what CMIS is.

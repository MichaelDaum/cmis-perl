NAME
    WebService::Cmis - Perl interface to CMIS-compliant document management
    systems

SYNOPSIS
        use WebService::Cmis;

        my $client = WebService::Cmis::getClient(
          url => "http://.../alfresco/service/cmis",
        );

        $client->login(
          user => "...",
          password => "..."
        );

        my $repo = $client->getRepository;
        my $root = $client->getRootFolder;

DESCRIPTION
    This library provides a CMIS client library for Perl that can be used to
    work with CMIS-compliant repositories such as Alfresco, IBM FileNet,
    Nuxeo and others. CMIS is an OASIS approved specification with backing
    by major ECM players including those mentioned as well as Microsoft,
    Oracle, and SAP.

    CMIS providers must expose both Web Services and Restful AtomPub
    bindings. WebService::Cmis uses the Restful AtomPub binding to
    communicate with the CMIS repository. All you have to tell
    WebService::Cmis is the repository's service URL and your credentials.
    There is nothing to install on the server side.

    See the
    http://docs.oasis-open.org/cmis/CMIS/v1.0/cs01/cmis-spec-v1.0.html for a
    full understanding of what CMIS is.

METHODS
    getClient(%params) -> WebService::Cmis::Client
        Static method to create a cmis client. The client serves as an agent
        to fulfill all operations while contacting the document management
        system.

        While passing on all provided parameters to the real client
        constructor, the "impl" parameter is used to point to the class that
        actually implements the client, defaulting to
        WebService::Cmis::Client::BasicAuthClient.
